                Students are encouraged to tackle real-world problems
                and engage in hands-on projects that require critical
                thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration. This approach
                not only fosters a deeper understanding of subject matter

                to apply their knowledge in meaningful ways.A departure from traditional rote memorization,
